The mce-libhybris-plugin implements a mce plugin that allows mce to
use Android libhardware via libhybris to control for example display
brightness and enable/disable input from proximity and light sensors.

The idea of "hybris-plugin" (this package) is shortly:
- it uses no mce functions or data types
- it can be compiled independently from mce
- it exposes no libhybris/android datatypes/functions

And the idea of "hybris-module" (part of mce) is:
- it contains functions with the same names as "hybris-plugin"
- if called, the functions will load & call "hybris-plugin" code
- if "hybris-plugin" is not present "hybris-module" functions still
  work, but return failures for everything

Put together:
- mce code can assume that libhybris code is always available and
  callable during hw probing activity
- if hybris plugin is not installed (or if some hw is not supported by
  the underlying android code), failures will be reported and mce can
  try other existing ways to proble hw controls
