# Optional max_brightness override
# At least in Sony Xperia X / f5121 max_brightness files do not
# contain true maximum brightness. Additionally the values that
# are present by default are such that they cause led color
# representation to be skewed. In such cases these configuration
# entries can be used for overriding max_brightness content for
# all / select channels.
